# TwitchSpeller

This script allows Twitch to play a game of Twitch Spells. You may have seen concepts in youtube videos where the title is something like "If chat spells a word..." or the alike. This is basically that. It simply does this and nothing else.

Known issues:
Due to how twitch rate limits, words that have the same letter as before may get processed slower, this is just something I cannot control.

## Setup
To setup the code, you will need Python. The recommended version is Python 3.12.

Once that is done, you will need to run the following command to finish setup.

# Running the code

Once Python 3.12, modify the settings.py file to your likings.

# Note

This code is modified and based off of DougDoug's Twitch Plays Code which can be found at https://github.com/DougDougGithub/TwitchPlays
